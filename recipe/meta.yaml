# for the actual `uv` CLI tool (which does not require or link against `python`), see:
# - https://github.com/conda-forge/uv-feedstock
#
# _this_ package provides the `site-packages` content of the upstream PyPI package to:
# - appease `pip check` for downstreams which (presently) might use `uv`
#   programatically as a `run` dependency
# - eventually to provide a PEP517 backend as a `host` dependency, which _does_ require python
#
# for more context, see:
# - https://github.com/conda-forge/uv-feedstock/issues/42

  patches:
    # replaces `maturin` with `setuptools`
    #
    # this avoids
    # - populating `(Library/)bin`
    # - forcing {os x arch x python} builds
    # and enables
    # - the `uv` CLI (which can install its _own_ python) to be installed separately
    - 0000-no-rust.patch
    # provide binary path in `sys.prefix`
    #
    # this replaces machinery which doesn't work with conda-forge packaging on osx/win
    # with a `sys.prefix`-relative path to the `uv` CLI provided by conda-forge/uv-feedstock
